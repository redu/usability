# Usability
## What is the goal of this branch?
To proactively report any behavior/usability issue that might affect the overall User Experience of Redu. ISO define usability as: 
> “The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”

By this definition, we should report a usability issue every time someone realize that the interface cannot achieve the following *standart* metrics:
- **Learnability**: how easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
- **Efficiency**: once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- **Memorability**: when users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re establish proficiency?
- **Errors**: how many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
- **Satisfaction**: how pleasant is it to use the design?

## How can you report a usability issue?

1. Generate and upload a **screenshot** of the interface's context;
2. Inform **where** this issue come from (in Redu's architecture);
3. Inform **what** the user wanted to do;
4. Inform **why** he couldn't do what he wanted;
5. Inform if there was some **frustation** because of this issue.

Some informations may be difficult (or impossible) to note. In these cases, you have to be careful about your personal assumptions from the facts it is shown.
## How can you rank a issue?
There are three labels you must use in order to inform priority:

1. **High**: issues that have a great impact in achieving a wanted task by the user and/or causes impediment in accomplish Redu's strategic decisions;
2. **Low**: issues that will not affect the overall User Experience in unpleasant way;
3. **Next Version**: issues that may be hard to solve in the current version of the U.I. and/or have a need for more than two iterations to be ready.

P.S.: _Next Version_'s issues must be together of _High_ or _Low_ labels.
