# Usability
### What is the goal of this branch?
ISO define usability as: 
> “The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”

By this definition, we should report a usability issue every time someone realize that the interface cannot achieve the following *standart* metrics:
- **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
- **Efficiency**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re establish proficiency?
- **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
- **Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design?

Each member is allowed to proactively report any behavior that might affect our User Experience.

### How can you report a usability issue?
You must:
- Generate and upload a **screenshot** of the interface's context;
- **Where** this issue come from (in Redu's architecture);
- **What** the user wanted to do;
- **Why** he couldn't do what he wanted;
- If there was some **frustation** because of this issue.
